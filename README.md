# EDA-of-my-activities

I used to feel that I am the busiest person in the world and I tried hard to maintain work life balance. I still don't remember the last time when I hit the Gym. I wanted to learn swimming this summer but couldn't do it.

Was I really busy?

Well, not so...

I came to this conclusion after performing exploratory data analysis on my everyday activities..

I also found the scary insights and my every day things which are killing my time.

This project was started in July and is still run.

With these insights I have developed an IoT project, which helped me to manage my time and I started new hobbies and I could attain proper work life balance now.
